# üê≠ Micromouse Robot Project

This project showcases a compact, high-performance Micromouse robot built with minimal components and smart design choices. Despite its DIY aesthetic, the robot achieved **first place in two Micromouse competitions**, demonstrating robust navigation, efficient path planning, and reliable hardware integration.

## üöÄ Overview

Our goal was to design a lightweight, cost-effective Micromouse robot capable of navigating mazes quickly and accurately. The setup avoided complex localization systems in favor of a streamlined, practical approach that proved successful in real-world challenges.

## üß† Key Features

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 ‚Äî handles control logic, sensor data, and motor output.
- **Sensors**: 3x Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensors for real-time wall detection and maze mapping.
- **Motors**: N20 encoder motors for precise movement and speed feedback.
- **Motor Drivers**: Reliable driver circuits ensuring smooth control and fast turns.
- **Power**: Rechargeable battery pack providing stable voltage for extended runs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Design

- All components were **hand-soldered onto two stacked dot boards**, creating a modular and space-efficient layout.
- Although the ESP32 includes built-in **IMU and magnetometer**, we opted not to use them, relying solely on ToF sensors for simplicity and performance.
- The robot‚Äôs compact form factor contributed to its maneuverability and consistent speed in maze runs.

## üìà Skills Gained

Through this project, we developed and refined skills in:
- Embedded programming with the ESP32
- Motor control and PID tuning
- Sensor fusion and data filtering
- Maze solving algorithms (e.g., flood-fill)
- Real-time navigation and motion planning
- Hardware prototyping and debugging
