## üß† Key Features

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 ‚Äî handles control logic, sensor data, and motor output.
- **Sensors**: 3x Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensors for real-time wall detection and maze mapping.
- **Motors**: N20 encoder motors for precise movement and speed feedback.
- **Motor Drivers**: Reliable driver circuits ensuring smooth control and fast turns.
- **Power**: Rechargeable battery pack providing stable voltage for extended runs.
